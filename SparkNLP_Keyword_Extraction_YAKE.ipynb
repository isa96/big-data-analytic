       "SUBJECTIVE: This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span>. She <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">used</span> to have <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span> when she lived in <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Seattle</span> but she thinks they are worse here. In the past, she has tried <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Claritin</span>, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Zyrtec</span>. Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">used</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Allegra</span> also. She <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">used</span> that last summer and she began using it again <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">two</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">weeks</span> ago. It does not appear to be working very <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">well</span>. She has <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">used</span> over-the-counter <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sprays</span> but no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">prescription</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sprays</span>. She does have asthma but doest not require daily <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">medication</span> for this and does not <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">think</span> it is flaring up. MEDICATIONS: Her only <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">medication</span> currently is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Ortho</span> Tri-Cyclen and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Allegra</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ALLERGIES</span>: She has no known medicine <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span>. OBJECTIVE: Vitals: <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Weight</span> was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78. HEENT: Her throat was mildly <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">erythematous</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> exudate. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Nasal</span> mucosa was <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">erythematous</span> and swollen. Only <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">clear</span> drainage was seen. TMs were <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">clear</span>. Neck: Supple <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> adenopathy. Lungs: <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Clear</span>. ASSESSMENT: Allergic rhinitis. PLAN: 1. She will try <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Zyrtec</span> instead of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Allegra</span> again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">think</span> she has <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">prescription</span> coverage so that might be cheaper. 2. Samples of Nasonex <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">two</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sprays</span> in each nostril given for three <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">weeks</span>. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">prescription</span> was written as <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">well</span>. "

Please refer to chart for <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> and physical, as well as the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">medical</span> records regarding his <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergic</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">reaction</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">treatment</span> at ABC <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Medical</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Center</span> for further details and studies. In summary, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> had an <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Medical</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Center</span> to XYZ <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Medical</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Center</span> due to a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">renal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">failure</span> requiring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dialysis</span> and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">reaction</span> was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dialysis</span> shunt infection. In summary, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> states he has some problems with tolerating grass <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span>, environmental and inhalant <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span> occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions. He currently is not taking any medication for <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span>. He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control. No further problems have been <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span> upon his discharge and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">treatment</span>, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring. PAST <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">MEDICAL</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">HISTORY</span>: <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">History</span> of urticaria, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">renal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">failure</span> with <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertension</span> possible source of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">renal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">failure</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dialysis</span> times 2 years and a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertension</span>. PAST SURGICAL <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">HISTORY</span>: PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dialysis</span>. FAMILY <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">HISTORY</span>: Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> of food <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span>, and there is also a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">history</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertension</span>. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ALLERGIES</span>: Heparin causing thrombocytopenia. SOCIAL <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">HISTORY</span>: Denies tobacco or alcohol use. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches. GENERAL: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> distress. HEAD: Normocephalic. No <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">masses</span> or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lesions</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. FACE: No facial tenderness or asymmetry <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. EYES: Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. Extraocular movements are intact <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. EARS: The tympanic membranes are intact <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span> with a good light reflex. The external auditory canals are clear with no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lesions</span> or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">masses</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits. NOSE: The nasal cavities are patent <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. The nasal septum is midline. There are no nasal discharges. No <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">masses</span> or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lesions</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. THROAT: The oral mucosa appears healthy. Dental hygiene is maintained well. No oropharyngeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">masses</span> or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lesions</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. No postnasal drip <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. NECK: The neck is supple with no adenopathy or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">masses</span> palpated. The trachea is midline. The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules. NEUROLOGIC: Facial nerve is intact <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. No wheeze <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. IMPRESSION: 1. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Acute</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergic</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">reaction</span>, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex. 2. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Renal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">failure</span> requiring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dialysis</span>. 3. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Hypertension</span>. RECOMMENDATIONS: RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergies</span> was performed, and we will get the results back to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> with further recommendations to follow. If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions. At this point, I would recommend the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergic</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">reaction</span>, and I would consider this an allergy. Being on atenolol, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> has a more difficult time treating <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergic</span> reactions. An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> angioedema or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergic</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">reaction</span> or sensation of impending <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">allergic</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">reaction</span> and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">treatment</span> recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.

       "HISTORY: I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinusitis</span>. As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinusitis</span> about two to three months ago with <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">facial</span> discomfort, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">symptoms</span>. She states she really has sinus <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">problems</span>, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">much</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">improvement</span> with antibiotics. She had a CT of her paranasal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinuses</span> identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinuses</span> with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">turbinate</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertrophy</span> was also <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span> when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">septum</span> deviation to the left. She currently is not taking any medication for her <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinuses</span>. She also has <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span> that she is having some <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">problems</span> with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ear</span> popping and fullness. Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> tympanometry, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> speech discrimination. She has tried topical <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> corticosteroid therapy without <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">much</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">improvement</span>. She tried Allegra without <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">much</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">improvement</span> and she believes the Allegra may have caused <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">problems</span> with balance to worsen. She notes her <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dizziness</span> to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">much</span> worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ear</span> fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span> in her ears. She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> injury. She believes she has some degree of allergy <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">symptoms</span>. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinusitis</span>, hypertension and history of weight change. She is currently 180 pounds. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. FAMILY HISTORY: Strong for heart disease and alcoholism. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: DynaCirc. ALLERGIES: Egg-based products cause hives. SOCIAL HISTORY: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day. She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue. She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches. GENERAL: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> distress. HEAD: Normocephalic. No masses or lesions <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. FACE: No <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">facial</span> tenderness or asymmetry <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. EYES: Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. Extraocular movements are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">intact</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. No nystagmus. EARS: During Hallpike examination, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position. No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> did subjectively report <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dizziness</span>, which was repeated twice. No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span> during the exam. Tympanic membranes were <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span> to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">intact</span>. No signs of middle <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ear</span> effusion or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ear</span> canal inflammation. NOSE: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> appears congested. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Turbinate</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertrophy</span> is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. There are no signs of any <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinusitis</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Septum</span> is midline, slightly deviated to the left. THROAT: There is clear postnasal drip. Oral hygiene is good. No masses or lesions <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. Both vocal cords move well to midline. NECK: The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated. The trachea is midline. The thyroid gland is of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> size with no nodules. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. No wheeze <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">noted</span>. NEUROLOGIC: <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Facial</span> nerve is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">intact</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">bilaterally</span>. The remaining cranial nerves are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">intact</span> without focal deficit. PROCEDURE: Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">turbinate</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertrophy</span> and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">septum</span> deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly. IMPRESSION: 1. Probable increasing <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">problems</span> with allergic rhinitis and chronic <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">sinusitis</span>, both contributing to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span>'s <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">symptoms</span>. 2. Subjective <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dizziness</span>, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ear</span> causes of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dizziness</span>, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time. 3. Inferior <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">turbinate</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hypertrophy</span>. 4. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Nasal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">septum</span> deformity. RECOMMENDATIONS: An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function. She was placed on Veramyst <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> spray two sprays each nostril <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">daily</span> and even twice <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">daily</span> if <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">symptoms</span> are worsening. A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was given instruction on use of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">nasal</span> saline irrigation to be used twice <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">daily</span> and Clarinex 5 mg <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">daily</span> was recommended. After the patients' ENG examination, we will see the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> back for further evaluation and treatment recommendations. In light of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span>'s atypical <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dizziness</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">symptoms</span>, I cannot rule out other pathology at this time, and I informed her if there are any <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> changes or <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">problems</span> with regards to her balance or any other <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">acute</span> changes, which she attributes associated with her <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">dizziness</span>, she most likely should pursue an emergent visit to the emergency room. Thank you for allowing me to participate with the care of your <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span>. "

She says her <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">asthma</span> has been <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">worse</span> over the last three months. She has been <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">using</span> her inhaler <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">daily</span>. Her allergies seem to be a little bit <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">worse</span> as well. Her husband has been hauling corn and this <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">seems</span> to aggravate things. She has not been taking <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Allegra</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">daily</span> but when she does take it, it <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">seems</span> to help somewhat. She has not been taking her <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Flonase</span> which has helped her in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">past</span>. She also notes that in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">past</span> she was on <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Advair</span> but she got some <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">vaginal</span> irritation with that. She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cycle</span>. She has been more impatient around that time. Says otherwise her mood is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> during the rest of the month.

Blood drug screen - no drugs detected. CLINOCOPATHOLIGICAL CORRELATION: Cause of death of this six year old female is asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. The body of this six year old female was first <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">seen</span> by me after I was called to an address XYZ, on 12/26/96. I arrived at the scene <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">approximately</span> 8 PM on 12/26 and entered the house where the decedent's body was located at <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">approximately</span> 8:20 PM. A brief examination of the body disclosed a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> around the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> and a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> around the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> wrist. Also noted was a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">small</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">area</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span> or contusion below the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> ear on the lateral aspect of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> cheek. A prominent dried <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span> was <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">present</span> on the lower <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span>. After examining the body, I <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> the residence at <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">approximately</span> 8:30 PM. EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OF INJURY: Located just below the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> ear at the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> angle of the mandible, 1.5 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inches</span> below the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> external auditory canal is a 3/8 x 1/4 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inch</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">area</span> of rust colored <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span>. In the lateral aspect of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> lower eyelid on the inner conjunctival surface is a 1 mm in maximum dimension <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhage</span>. Very fine, less than 1 mm <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhages</span> are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">present</span> on the skin of the upper eyelids bilaterally as well as on the lateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> cheek. On everything the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> upper eyelid there are much smaller, less than 1 mm <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhages</span> located on the conjunctival surface. Possible <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhages</span> are also <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">seen</span> on the conjunctival surfaces of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> upper and lower eyelids, but liver mortis on this side of the face makes definite identification difficult. A deep <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> furrow encircles the entire <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span>. The width of the furrow varies from one- eight of an <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inch</span> to five/sixteenths of an <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inch</span> and is horizontal in orientation, with little upward deviation. The skin of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">anterior</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> above and below the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> furrow <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">contains</span> areas of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhage</span> and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span> encompassing an <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">area</span> measuring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">approximately</span> 3 x 2 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inches</span>. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> furrow crosses the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">anterior</span> midline of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> just below the laryngeal prominence, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">approximately</span> at the level of the cricoid cartilage. It is almost completely horizontal with slight upward deviation from the horizontal towards the back of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span>. The midline of the furrow mark on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">anterior</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> is 8 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inches</span> below the top of the head. The midline of the furrow mark on the posterior <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> is 6.75 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inches</span> below the top of the head. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">area</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span> and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhage</span> of the skin of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">anterior</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> includes on the lower <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span>, just to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> of the midline, a roughly triangular, parchment-like rust colored <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span> which measures 1.5 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inches</span> in length with a maximum width of 0.75 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inches</span>. This roughly triangular shaped <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">abrasion</span> is obliquely oriented with the apex superior and lateral. The remainder of the abrasions and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhages</span> of the skin above and below the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">anterior</span> projection of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> furrow are nonpatterned, purple to rust colored, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">present</span> in the midline, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span>, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> areas of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">anterior</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span>. The skin just above the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ligature</span> furrow along the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> side of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">neck</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">contains</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhage</span> composed of multiple confluent very <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">small</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhages</span> as well as several larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">petechial</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">hemorrhages</span> measuring up to one-sixteenth and one-eight of an <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">inch</span> in maximum dimension.

       "SUMMARY OF CLINICAL HISTORY: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was a 35-year-old African-American male with no significant past medical history who called <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">EMS</span> with shortness of breath and chest pain. Upon <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">EMS</span> arrival, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 90%. At the scene, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">EMS</span> administered breathing treatments and checked <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span> sounds that did not reveal any <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">fluid</span> in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span> fields. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">EMS</span> also reports <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was agitated upon their arrival at his residence. Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> became unresponsive, apneic, and had oxygen saturations from 80-90%. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span>'s <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">heart</span> rate decreased to asystole, was intubated with good breath sounds and air movement. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Patient</span> then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45 minutes. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was administered TPA with no improvement. Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was administered D5W, Narcan, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">multiple</span> rounds of epinephrine and atropine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation with cardioversion/defibrillation resulting in asystole. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was pronounced dead at 1605 with fixed, dilated pupils, no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">heart</span> sounds, no pulse and no spontaneous respirations. DESCRIPTION OF GROSS LESIONS EXTERNAL EXAMINATION: The body is that of a 35-year-old well-developed, well-nourished male. There is no peripheral edema of the extremities. There is an area of congestion/erythema on the upper chest and anterior neck. There are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">multiple</span> small areas of hemorrhage bilaterally in the conjunctiva. A nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in place. There is an intravenous line in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> hand and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> femoral region. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> has <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">multiple</span> lead pads on the thorax. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> has no other major surgical scars. INTERNAL EXAMINATION (BODY CAVITIES): The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> and <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> pleural cavity contains 10 ml of clear <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">fluid</span> with no adhesions. The pericardial sac is yellow, glistening <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">fluid</span>. There is minimal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">fluid</span> in the peritoneal cavity. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">HEART</span>: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">heart</span> is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">large</span> with a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> shape and a weight of 400 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span>. The pericardium is intact. The epicardial fat is diffusely firm. As <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was greater than 48 hours post mortem, no TTC staining was utilized. Upon opening the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">heart</span> was <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grossly</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of infarction. There were slightly raised white plaques in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> ventricle wall lining. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> ventricle <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">measures</span> 2.2 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> ventricle <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">measures</span> 0.2 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>, the tricuspid ring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">measures</span> 11 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>, the pulmonic <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">measures</span> 8 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>, the mitral ring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">measures</span> 10.2 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>, and the aortic ring <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">measures</span> 7 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>. The foramen ovale is closed. The circulation is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> dominant. Examination of the great vessels of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">heart</span> reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis (20% stenosis) at the bifurcation of the LAD. AORTA: There is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and descending aorta. LUNGS: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span> weighed 630 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span>, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> weighed 710 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span>. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span> parenchyma is pink <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of congestion of hemorrhage. The bronchi are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grossly</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span>. In the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span>, there are two <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">large</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">organizing</span> thrombo-emboli. The first is located at the first branch of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> artery with an older, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">organizing</span> area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 1.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">x</span> 1.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">x</span> 2.5 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>. Surrounding this <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">organizing</span> area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation. The other <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">large</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">organizing</span>, adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 1.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">x</span> 1.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">x</span> 1.5 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cm</span>. There are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">multiple</span> other emboli located in smaller <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> vessels that show <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of distending the vessels they are located inside. GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM: The esophagus and stomach are <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> in appearance <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of ulcers or varices. The stomach contains approximately 800 ml, <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of any pills or other non-foodstuff material. The pancreas shows a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> lobular <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cut</span> surface with <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of autolysis. The duodenum, ileum, jejunum and colon are all <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grossly</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of abnormal vasculature or diverticula. An appendix is present and is unremarkable. The liver weighs 2850 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span> and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cut</span> surface reveals a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> liver with no fibrosis present <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grossly</span>. The gallbladder is in place with a probe patent bile duct through to the ampulla of Vater. RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM: The spleen is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">large</span> weighing 340 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span>, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cut</span> surface reveals a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> appearing white and red pulp. No abnormally <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">large</span> lymph nodes were noted. GENITOURINARY SYSTEM: The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> kidney weighs 200 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span>, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> weighs 210 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span>. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span> kidney contains a 1.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">x</span> 1.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">x</span> 1.0 simple cyst containing a clear <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">fluid</span>. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cut</span> surface reveals a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> appearing cortex and medulla with intact calyces. The prostate and seminal vessels were <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cut</span> revealing <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> appearing prostate and seminal vesicle tissue <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">without</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of inflammation or embolus. ENDOCRINE SYSTEM: The adrenal glands are in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> position and weigh 8.0 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span> on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> and 11.6 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span> on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">left</span>. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">cut</span> surface of the adrenal glands reveals a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span> appearing cortex and medulla. The thyroid gland weighs 12.4 <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grams</span> and is <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">grossly</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">normal</span>. EXTREMITIES: Both legs and calves were measured and found to be very similar in circumference. Both legs were also milked and produced no clots in the venous system. CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION This <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> died shortly after a previous <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> embolus completely occluded the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> artery vasculature. The most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">multiple</span> old and new thromboemboli in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> vasculature of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span>. The autopsy revealed <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">multiple</span> emboli in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span> that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">organizing</span> were adherent to the vessel wall. In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response, which takes at least a few days. The fatal event was not the old emboli in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">lung</span>, but rather the thrombosis on top of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">large</span> saddle thrombus residing in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> artery. This created a high-pressure situation that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">right</span> ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span>'s demise. Although this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35-year-old man would develop a fatal <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> embolism. Virchow's triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies. The age of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed. The autopsy revealed no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of endothelial damage in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> vasculature that would have caused the occlusion. The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state. Some possibilities include obesity, trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden deficiency (as well as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and disorders of plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant. Of these risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was known to have. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> had no <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">evidence</span> of trauma, surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are unlikely. Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden being the most common). In summary, this <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> died of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">pulmonary</span> embolism, the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined. A definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history. SUMMARY AND REFLECTION WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY: I learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious, the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive. This <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span> was an otherwise completely healthy 35-year-old man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable state. REMAINING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS: Basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined. Once that question is answered I believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">patient</span>'s family. "
